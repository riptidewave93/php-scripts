These files are dated back from around 2011. They are an example of using php5-crypt to salt strings, pass them over http, and then decrypt the contents on the other side.

listener.php - Script that will print out a salted array
server.php - Script that will call listener.php, and convert the array back into a usable format.

Make sure that all Keys are the same between the files, otherwise you will have issues...
